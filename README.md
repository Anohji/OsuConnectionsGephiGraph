# OSU Connections in a Graph
Made in collaboration with [praeludiumOrbis](https://github.com/praeludiumOrbis)

## The project
This C# tool collects data from osu! user profiles. It recursively scrapes profiles starting from given user IDs, extracts connections (collabs), and processes the data into two CSV filesâ€”one for nodes (users) and one for edges (collaborations). This output can be directly imported into [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) for network analysis.

## Usage
<p>
The implest way to run is to install the .NET 8 runtime and run as local build.<br>
Create an appsettings.json in the root folder, consult appsettings.example.json for reference.<br>
Don't forget to set your osu! api key and the delay between each api call
</p>

```
dotnet run -- <arguments>
dotnet run -- --help
```

### Example

```bash
dotnet run -- -u "12345,67891,13456" -d 3
```

<p>
The result will be edges.csv and nodes.csv, ready for import into Gephi.
